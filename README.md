# MagneticFieldSensor
App measures magnetic field around by using the phone's magnetic sensor. 
It helps to detect metal objects (steel, iron), the magnetic field level will increase when the metal object or a magnet is near. 
Gold, silver or copper coins cannot be detected since they are classified as non-ferrous metal.
The app shows a warning toast message "Beware of the Magneto, he is coming!" when magnitude value becomes more than 500.00 ÂµT.
